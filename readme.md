* It's pretty simple

You have the _parts folder that contains the header.php, head.php, and footer.php. Header.php calls in head.php

Then, you have index.php that pulls everything together. You can refernce that file to understand how sections get called in.

That's it. 

Run `php -S localhost:8000` and you're all set.
